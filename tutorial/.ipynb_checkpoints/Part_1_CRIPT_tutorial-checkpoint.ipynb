    "**Welcome to CRIPT!**\n",
    "\n",
    "CRIPT's mission is to develop a digital ecosystem for polymers. As part of that mission, we have generated a data model which provides rules on how to format data so that data can be easily stored, shared, and searched. An additional aspect of a digital ecosystem is the database itself. For CRIPT we have chosen to use MongoDB (a cloud document database service). Attempting to manually, write data into the data model and upload it to the database can be a complex and time consuming process. To address this issue, we have built a Python API (Application Programming Interface) which provides a more simplified interface for entering data and handles a lot of the formatting for the user. Additionally, the API allows us to incorporate additional tools like data validation, data visualization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../tutorial/supporting_files/pics/P1_data_to_cript.svg\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "To help users learn CRIPT's API we have put together a series of tutorial. The tutorials will teach both the Python commands needed to use the API and also provide lessons about the underlying data model. The tutorial is written with the expectation that you have a very basic understanding of the Python programing language. (If you have no Python experience, fear not, they are many tutorials on YouTube where you can learn it within a day or so. Here's a recommend one: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)) \n",
    "\n",
    "<u> **Main Tutorial Series:** </u>\n",
    "* Part 1: Will take you through the process of installing the CRIPT API, creating your user account and joining a group.\n",
    "* Part 2: Will take you through the process of creating a collection and experiment. It will also demonstrate how to input a basic experiment data for the anionic polymerization of styrene.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Additional Tutorials:</u>\n",
    "* Additional Experiment Example (diblock bottlebrush synthesis and material properties studies)\n",

    "## <u>CRIPT API Overview</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the code let me give you some high level context on how the CRIPT API and data model is organized and works (Check out the figure below.). The main data structure consists of the following nodes:\n",
    "* User\n",
    "    * Contains information about an individual using the database\n",
    "    * Example: John Doe, Jane Doe\n",
    "* Group\n",
    "    * Contains information about group and ownership of collections and experiments lies with groups\n",
    "    * Example: CRIPT development team, Olsen Lab, MIT chemistry department\n",
    "* Collection (Coll.)\n",
    "    * Contains a grouping of experiments, with the purpose to provide a hierarchical organization to non-linear, but related experiments\n",
    "    * Example: ROMP Kinetic Experiments, Polyolefin Library\n",
    "* Experiment (Expt.)\n",
    "    * Contains complete set of references to all the nodes (Material, Process, Data, Simulation) of an experiment.\n",
    "    * Example: Synthesis of PS-b-PB, ATRP of styrene\n",
    "* Publication (Pub.)\n",
    "    * Contains Collections which embodies a literature publication\n",
    "    * Example: \n",
    "* Inventory\n",
    "    * Contains a list of Material Nodes\n",
    "    * Example: Olsen Lab Inventory, ROP monomers, Stockroom Chemicals\n",
    "* Material\n",
    "    * Contains identity and property data for a chemical\n",
    "    * Example: styrene, toluene, polystyrene, polyethylene\n",
    "* Process\n",
    "    * Contains ingredient list, quantities, and procedure information\n",
    "    * Example: Anionic Polymerization of styrene, \n",
    "* Data\n",
    "    * Contains meta data for raw or processed data\n",
    "    * Example: 1H NMR, SEC trace, IR spectrum\n",
    "* Simulation (Sim.)\n",
    "    * Under Construction\n",

    "\n",
    "These are the nodes that we will look to create with the API code and save to the database (which we can access the database through `CriptDB`). The first half of this list is mostly organizational tools, with the last 4 nodes (`Material`, `Process`, `Data`, `Simulation`) being where the bulk of the data will be stored.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:SteelBlue\">  Everything in CRIPT is a `node` (`User`, `Group`, `Experiment`, `Material`, `Data`, ...). We use the word `node` as CRIPT can be thought of a graph with nodes holding a bunch of related information and lines showing the relationship between nodes. This idea of CRIPT being a graph will become more apparent you continue this tutorial. For now just remember that a node is just a group of related information or if you are an avid python user, a node is just a python class.</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a few additional helper nodes that we will use to assemble the mains nodes. These helper nodes consist of the following (they will be explained more later):\n",
    "* Identity (Iden)\n",
    "* Ingredient (Ingr)\n",
    "* File \n",
    "* Condition (Cond)\n",
    "* Property (Prop)\n",
    "* Unit\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also 3 other nodes that haven't been mentioned (`Version Control`, ` Data Lake`, `Model Lake`). `Version Control` is something we won't work with directly, but it is working in the background keeping track of the changes to every node (node history). The ` Data Lake` is the database location where all your raw data (NMR, SEC traces, images, etc.) live. It's not something you access direct, but it is indirectly accessed through the `Data` node. The `Model Lake` is currently still under construction.\n",

This is done easily since we had our last view be stored in the `current_groups` variable. So we can just pass `current_groups`, with the select the number it was in the list, into `user.node.c_group`. \n",
