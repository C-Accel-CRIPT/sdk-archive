The reason we break out the `Material nodes`, `Process nodes` and `Data nodes` and don't just group them into the `Experiment node` is because a single `Material` may be referenced in multiple experiments and this allows us to just refenence the `Material node` instead of duplicating the data.

In terms of best practices (for small molecules), using existing materials is always prefered, followed by referencing, and coping as the least prefered method as duplicates of the same material hinders the effectiveness of the database.
