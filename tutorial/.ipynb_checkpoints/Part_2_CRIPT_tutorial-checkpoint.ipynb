You can think of an experiment as a page in the notebook, except it doesn't hold any of the data it just reference the nodes that do. The reason we break out the `Material nodes`, `Process nodes` and `Data nodes` and don't just group them into the `Experiment node` is because a single `Material` may be referenced in multiple experiments and this allows us to just refenence the `Material node` instead of duplicating the data. Additionally, this seperated data model is more flexable to cases where someone makes a material in one experiment and uses it or studies in a different experiment. There is also huge benfits in terms of search perferomance and reduced memory usage, but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n",

We broke it into these steps to help communicate the process of creating a `Material Node`, however it can be more sinsincly done in one step, as shown below.
